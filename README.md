# React To-Do List App

A React-based To-Do List application that allows users to manage daily tasks efficiently. Users can add, delete, and mark tasks as complete, with additional functionality like task validation, sorting, filtering, and data persistence using localStorage.

## Project Goal

Develop a React To-Do List component allowing task addition, removal, and completion marking. Validate task input, display tasks dynamically, and offer optional sorting, filtering, and localStorage integration. Submit code on GitHub with brief testing guidance.

## Features

-  Add new tasks with input validation
- ❌ Delete tasks from the list
-  Mark tasks as completed/pending
-  Filter tasks (All, Completed, Pending)
-  Sort tasks by ID or name
-  Persistent data using localStorage

## Testing Guidance

You can manually test the application using these steps:
1. Add multiple tasks to the list.
2. Try adding an empty task (should be prevented).
3. Delete a task and check if it’s removed.
4. Mark a task as complete and verify the UI reflects it.
5. Use the filter options to view different task types.
6. Refresh the page and verify tasks persist.

## Run Locally

Clone the project and run it on your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/3laxmi/React-To-do-list.git
cd React-To-do-list
npm install
npm start
